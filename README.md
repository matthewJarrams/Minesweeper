# Minesweeper
Fun side project to develop a game of minesweeper

Two versions. 

A text game version in MinesweeperText. Which is the same as the GUI version, except played through the console. 
The program has a 'cheat' function to make testing easier and will print the entite board out for you with the mines and numbers.

The second version is in MinesweeperGUI/Minesweeper. Which is a GUI for a game of minesweeper. Where you left click to guess and right click to place flags.
