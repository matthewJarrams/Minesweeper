# Minesweeper
Fun side project to develop a game of minesweeper

To use create a java project and copy the two files in Minesweeper/src to the project.

The program has a 'cheat' function to make testing easier and will print the entite board out for you with the mines and numbers. 
To stop this comment out this section out in the PrintBoard function.

Have Fun!
